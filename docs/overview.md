# Flight-Prof Lite – Project Charter

**Objective**  
Build a simplified flight-level profitability system mirroring Southwest Airlines' FP&A "Flight Prof" tool.

**Deliverables**
1) Python allocation engine with ±1–2% reconciliation to Form 41 monthly totals  
2) Interactive dashboard (network heatmap, stage-length curve, top routes, sensitivity)  
3) QA + sensitivity tests (fuel ±10%, LF ±2 pts)  
4) 2-page FP&A Review Memo (PDF)  
5) Recruiter Test-Drive Script (README + CLI)

**Success Criteria**  
- Reconciliation within ±1–2% per month and cost bucket  
- Dashboard live and consistent with tables  
- README lets a recruiter reproduce outputs in <5 minutes
